## Config
1. Clone the repository into a directory on your local machine. If you have Git installed on your machine then you can run `git clone https://github.com/ash-williams/Spacebook` in your terminal
2. In the root of the cloned repository, create a `.env` file with your DB config details. The file should look like the following:
```
DB_HOST=<URL for mudfoot>
DB_PORT=<port number for mudfoot>
DB_USER=<your mudfoot username>
DB_PASS=<your mudfoot password>
```
3. Edit the first line in `/app/scripts/tables.sql` and `/app/scripts/dummy_data.sql`. Replace `ashley_student` with your own Mudfoot username.
4. In the terminal, run `npm install` to install the dependencies
5. Copy the contents of the yaml file in the resources directory into editor.swagger.io
6. Run the server with `npm run dev`
7. In Postman, send a POST request to 'http://localhost:3333/api/1.0.0/reset' - this will create your database tables
8. In Postman, send a POST request to 'http://localhost:3333/api/1.0.0/resample' - this will add the dummy data
9. Paste the contents of the YAML file in `/resources/` into 'http://editor.swagger.io' for documentation on each of the end points
10. Continue to test everything is working using Postman
